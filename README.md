# GOTO-ConvNet
Source code for the Convolutional Neural Network to classify astronomical objects using the GOTO data. 4th year Astro project at University of Sheffield


Code requires use of the Galaxy Zoo 2 database (can be downloaded from: https://data.galaxyzoo.org/) in order for survey matching and pre-labelling, and must be in CSV format.

The model is then trained, and tested using the ConvNet_model.py file, and will produce a confusion matrix, and examples of 25 incorrectly labelled images.

Also included the project report where the motivations and design choices are explained in the 'Developing_a_Convolutional_Neural_Network_to_Classify_Detections_in_Large_Astronomical_Surveys.pdf' file
